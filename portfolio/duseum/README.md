## What It Is

Duseum is an online museum where artists publish their work and art lovers discover and support creators directly. The platform is built around a **dual-profile model**: every account can hold a Viewer profile for browsing and an Author profile for publishing — simultaneously.

Access is gated by a layered subscription system:

| Who | What they can see |
|---|---|
| Free Viewer | A curated free tier of public artwork per Author |
| Platform Subscriber | Unlimited public artwork from all Authors |
| Author Subscriber | A specific Author's private collection |
| Author | Their own content at all visibility levels |

Authors can also pay to be **Featured on the homepage** — either as the randomly-selected Daily Featured Author (free, automatic) or as a paid Weekly Featured Author booking a specific calendar week.

## Skills Demonstrated

### AWS & Cloud Architecture

- **Serverless-first design** — 11 independent Lambda functions, zero always-on compute
- **AWS CDK (TypeScript)** — infrastructure as code across 7 stacks: Storage, Auth, CDN, Messaging, API, Monitoring, Networking
- **DynamoDB single-table design** — 7 GSIs, pre-defined access patterns, no full scans
- **Amazon Cognito** — User Pool with Google OAuth federation, JWT-based sessions (access + refresh token rotation), Post-Confirmation Lambda trigger for auto-profile creation
- **CloudFront signed URLs** — private art pieces served via time-limited signed URLs; signing happens in Lambda, never in the browser
- **S3 + CloudFront CDN** — private media bucket with OAC; SPA bucket with React Router fallback
- **SQS** — two queues: Stripe webhook ingestion (API Gateway → SQS → Lambda, no hot-path Lambda) and new-piece notification fan-out
- **AWS SES** — transactional email for follower notifications with one-click unsubscribe (HMAC-signed tokens, CAN-SPAM compliant)
- **EventBridge scheduled rules** — daily featured Author selection (00:00 UTC) and weekly feature rotation (Monday 00:00 UTC)
- **Secrets Manager** — all Stripe keys, CloudFront signing key pair, HMAC secret; nothing in environment variables or code
- **SSM Parameter Store** — cross-stack wiring; no CDK `Fn.importValue()`
- **CloudWatch alarms + X-Ray tracing** — Lambda error rates, SQS DLQ depth, API 5xx rate, structured JSON logging

### Backend Engineering

- **Node.js 20 + TypeScript 5** throughout
- **Middy 5.x middleware** — auth, validation, error handling, structured logging
- **Modular Lambda pattern** — one Lambda per route group; shared business logic in `packages/shared`
- **Stripe Billing + Connect Express** — platform subscriptions, per-Author subscriptions, Stripe Connect onboarding, application fees, Billing Portal
- **Stripe Payment Intents** — one-time weekly feature booking fee with idempotent webhook processing
- **Webhook idempotency** — DynamoDB idempotency table checked before every Stripe event processed; safe to receive duplicates
- **Async notification fan-out** — publish one SQS message on artwork creation; `notifications-lambda` pages through Follow/Subscriber records and sends SES emails in batches of 50; never blocks the API response
- **Access control at the Lambda layer** — `checkArtPieceAccess()` in shared package; never enforced only in the frontend

### DevOps & CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions** with OIDC-based AWS authentication — no static AWS keys
- **Turborepo** — monorepo build orchestration with caching across 12 workspaces
- **Two-environment pipeline** (dev + prod) within a single shared AWS account using `{env}` resource name prefixes
- **esbuild bundling** — lean Lambda bundles; cold start budget < 1s
- **Smoke tests** post-deploy — curl-based endpoint verification uploaded to S3 as JSON artifacts
- **Integration tests** — Vitest with real DynamoDB/Lambda execution via MiniStack
- **MiniStack (Docker Compose)** — local AWS emulation for DynamoDB, SQS, S3, and SSM; seed scripts for local dev

### Frontend Engineering

- **React 18 + Vite** — SPA with code-split lazy routes
- **React Query (TanStack Query v5)** — server state, paginated lists, optimistic UI mutations
- **Zustand** — lightweight auth store (Cognito session + profile state)
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first design system; locked token set (no arbitrary colors)
- **AWS Amplify (Auth)** — Cognito token management, OAuth redirect, refresh rotation
- **Stripe.js + React Stripe Elements** — Payment Intent confirmation for weekly feature booking
- **Custom design system** — Playfair Display + DM Sans + DM Mono; warm editorial palette (ink/parchment/gold); no external component libraries
- **Scroll reveal, drag-and-drop, Fisher-Yates shuffle** — all implemented without adding dependencies

### System Design Patterns

- **Single-table DynamoDB design** with composite keys and explicit GSIs
- **Event-driven architecture** — art piece publish → SQS → fan-out; Stripe webhook → SQS → idempotent handler
- **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** — every feature gated behind a spec with approval before implementation
- **Dual-environment isolation** — dev and prod on one AWS account, fully isolated by resource naming
- **Configurable platform behavior without deploys** — free tier limits, feature fees, slot counts stored in DynamoDB config table; Admin UI writes them at runtime

       ├─ S3 SPA Bucket       ← React build (Vite)
       ├─ API Gateway (HTTP API v2)
       │    └─ Lambda functions (per route group)
       │         ├─ artworks-lambda

       │         ├─ media-lambda
       │         └─ notifications-lambda (SQS trigger)
       └─ S3 Media Bucket     ← Art images (CloudFront signed URLs)

Async layer
  Stripe webhook  → API GW → SQS → subscriptions-webhook-lambda
  POST /artworks  → SQS    → notifications-lambda → SES (follower emails)
  EventBridge     → maintenance-lambda (daily 00:00 UTC + Monday 00:00 UTC)

Auth
  Amazon Cognito User Pool
    └─ Post-Confirmation → auth-triggers-lambda (auto-create Viewer profile)
```

## Project Notes

This project was built as a **portfolio piece demonstrating production-grade AI-driven development**. The entire codebase was designed and implemented using Claude Code (Anthropic) with a Spec-Driven Development workflow: every feature was gated behind an explicit spec, reviewed before implementation, and verified with a full monorepo typecheck.

See [RETRO.md](RETRO.md) for the full project retrospective — covering the development process, infrastructure lessons learned, and a recommended process for future AI-driven projects of this scale.
